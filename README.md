# 🦁 Dummy Clients

**Dummy Clients** is a **full-feature educational Solana client**, built in Rust.
It’s not a production validator — instead, it’s a **learning-first implementation** of Solana’s networking, ledger, PoH, consensus, runtime, and RPC layers.

Our mission: give developers the ability to **understand, build, and hack the Solana protocol itself** without needing datacenter-grade hardware.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Gossip Networking** → discover validators, slots, and cluster state
* **Ledger Store & Replay** → download and verify blocks locally
* **Proof of History Verifier** → replay Solana’s global clock
* **Consensus Simulator (Tower BFT)** → explore forks, voting, lockouts
* **Execution Runtime (Sealevel Lite)** → run transactions and programs
* **Custom RPC** → serve data directly from your local replayed ledger

All features are **real-world compatible** — same wire protocols, ledger format, and runtime behaviors as Solana Labs’ validator — but simplified and modular for clarity.

## 🧭 Why Build This?

Most Solana developers focus on dApps and smart contracts. Very few touch the **protocol internals**. Dummy Clients closes that gap.

By building and using it, you’ll:

* Learn **how validators work under the hood**
* Understand **networking, ledger, and consensus** at a deep level
* Gain skills to become a **protocol-level engineer** (not just a dApp dev)
* Contribute to the Solana ecosystem in **core infrastructure**

## 🛠️ Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1 — Gossip Listener

* Connect to Solana gossip over QUIC/UDP
* Log validator identities, slot announcements, and cluster health
* CLI tools: `dc gossip peers`, `dc gossip slots`

### 🔜 Phase 2 — Ledger Downloader & Parser

* Fetch blocks from validators
* Store in a local database
* Explore accounts & transactions offline

### 🔜 Phase 3 — Proof of History Verifier

* Implement PoH replay in Rust
* Confirm time-ordering of transactions

### 🔜 Phase 4 — Consensus Simulator (Tower BFT Lite)

* Simulate validator votes and fork choice
* Visualize finality and lockouts

### 🔜 Phase 5 — RPC Surface

* Implement JSON-RPC for `getBlock`, `getTransaction`, etc.
* Optional: add **custom analytics** beyond Solana RPC





📚 *Why*: Makes the client useful to external tools/dapps, like QuickNode or Helius.

---

## 🚀 Phase 6 — Mini Validator Mode
- **Replay** transactions locally for validation  
- **Forward** transactions to real validators (like a proxy)  
- **Simulate** partial ledger sync  

📚 *Why*: Bridges the gap between light client and full validator. Think of it as “training wheels” for Solana validation.

---

## 🔮 Phase 7 — Advanced Experiments
- **zk-Light Client**: Use zero-knowledge proofs to verify Solana state transitions trustlessly.  
- **Cross-Client Testing**: Compare behavior against Solana Labs + Firedancer implementations.  
- **Custom Modules**: Add unique tooling (e.g., “most active programs in last 10k slots”).  

📚 *Why*: Pushes Dummy Client into research-grade territory. Contributes to the future of Solana infrastructure.

---

## 🏆 Endgame
By completing this roadmap, Dummy Client evolves into a **full-fledged Solana light client** with validator DNA:  
- Networking (Gossip)  
- Ledger Sync (Blocks + Accounts)  
- PoH Verification  
- Consensus Simulation  
- RPC Exposure  
- Mini Validator Execution

* A toolkit for teaching protocol engineering.
* A path for developers to go beyond smart contracts into **core Solana**.
